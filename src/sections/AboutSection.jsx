            <h2>About Chelle's Cookies</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to Chelle's Cookies! I'm passionate about creating beautiful,
              delicious royal icing cookies that make your special moments even more memorable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each cookie is carefully crafted by hand with premium ingredients and decorated
              with intricate royal icing designs. From baby showers to weddings, birthdays to
              holidays, I love bringing your vision to life through edible art.
            </p>
            <p>
              What started as a hobby has blossomed into a business built on quality,
              creativity, and genuine care. Every cookie tells a story, and I'd
              be honored to be part of yours.
